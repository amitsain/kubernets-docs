How to monitor that a Pod is always running?

We can introduce probes. A liveness probe with a Pod is ideal in this scenario.

A liveness probe always checks if an application in a pod is running,  if this check fails the container gets restarted. This is ideal in many scenarios where the container is running but somehow the application inside a container crashes.

spec:
containers:
- name: liveness
image: k8s.gcr.io/liveness
args:
- /server
livenessProbe:
      httpGet:
        path: /healthz
